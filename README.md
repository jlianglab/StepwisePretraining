# Discriminative, Restorative, and Adversarial Learning: Stepwise Incremental Pretraining.
This repository provides a Keras implementation of the Discriminative, Restorative, and Adversarial Learning: Stepwise Incremental Pretraining

We extend and reimplemented five prominent self-supervised learning method and integrate them into a united framework that incorporates three learning components including Discriminative, Restorative, and Adversarial Learning.
